## Project Description

This is a Capstone project I completed in the Hyperion Dev Data Science Bootcamp. It contains visualisation of a dataset about arrests for violent crime in the 50 states of the USA in 1973. The dataset can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/halimedogan/usarrests.

The analysis consists of various visualisations of the data, including bar charts, scatter plots to show the relationships between different variables in the dataset, aggregated bar plots by region of the US, and heat maps to show the rates of violent crime in each US state.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies
This project was created in Python version 3.10.6. 

Python packages: numpy, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, geopandas. 

This project should be opened in a software which can open Jupyter Notebooks. It was created using Visual Studio Code.

### Installation
This project should be installed in the same folder as the csv document containing US Arrest data. The csv document should be named "USArrests.csv". This folder should also contain the shapefile of US states, which should be named "tl_2022_us_state.shp". 

### Running the program
Running the program will generate output within the ipynb document.
